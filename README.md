Some fun with the Python turtle

## About
For a computer science project I had to do at school, I had to learn how to use Turtle in Python. I was given tasks to do, and, as I have experience with this already, I might have done too much.
It quickly turned into just a bit of fun, and I decided that I should post the code to my GitHub. Why? Why not?

Don't expect much - they're all very simple tasks but some of them look pretty cool.

*Note: if you find any issues or bugs, don't bother submitting an issue or starting a pull request. I won't be maintaining this repo.*

### Enjoy!
